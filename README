Current implementation status:
 the following functions are (at least partially) implemented:
	F_b_buflen
	F_initscr
	F_getch		# Ignores in_mode, always uses cbreak mode
	F_input_isv	#  "
	F_addch		# Does not scroll when at bottom margin
	F_mvaddch	#  "
	F_addstr	#  "
	F_mvaddstr	#  "
	F_clear
	F_refresh	# Ignores font_fmt and attr.standout
	F_attrset
	F_attrget
	F_move

To compile, you will need a cross-compiling binutils (target=z80-unknown-coff).
These can be found packaged in the Debian repository as "binutils-z80".
The fully linked executable is then converted into a .TAP by './maketap'.
